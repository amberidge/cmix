## Expert Interview

### Musician
1. What do you want?

To be a "Feature". The main musical presence for a film or advertisement.

Major source of revenue for musicians is sync-representation. Contracting music for ads and film.


2. Major concerns:

Some people end up getting "shut out" of the music industry by way of contracts with Music labels.

Many start off with the inspiration of becoming singers, but when they get signed, the label will require a certain number of top 40 hits within a span of time. If the quota isn't made, the artist will be stuck working for the label, and not able to create music outside of the contract.

Labels tend to have a small handful of artists that they favor as their "brand."

Many talented artists are kept as song writers, but don't get into the lime lite because they aren't part of the "brand."

### Free- lance CG artists
